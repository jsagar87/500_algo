Running Zookeeper Standalone and then -> Kafka Standalone.

For Downloading, installing and Running zookeeper services followed standard documentation

https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html


Producing messages and consuming it using Kafka

https://dzone.com/articles/running-apache-kafka-on-windows-os


While in standlone it did not run straight away. Two challenges that I faced is running Zookeeper and running kafka:
1) Windows batch file to run Zookeeper didn't work straight away  as given int the articles/running-apache-kafka-on-windows-os.
2) Kafka service after starting for standlone did not responded to producer's request 

Solution or hack : Modified below line to next one in zkServer.bat
REM call %JAVA% "-Dzookeeper.log.dir=%ZOO_LOG_DIR%" "-Dzookeeper.root.logger=%ZOO_LOG4J_PROP%" -cp "%CLASSPATH%" %ZOOMAIN% "%ZOOCFG%" %*
call %JAVA% "-Dzookeeper.log.dir=%ZOO_LOG_DIR%" "-Dzookeeper.root.logger=%ZOO_LOG4J_PROP%" -cp "%CLASSPATH%" %ZOOMAIN% %*

and then while starting server supplied commandline options for port number and  data dir:
C:\Dev\zookeeper-3.4.12\bin>zkServer.cmd 2181 "C:\Dev\zookeeper-3.4.12\tmp\" 2000

1) Hack for zookeeper batch not working ->
I figured out that there was something wrong with windows batch file.
Command configured to start batch file was missing something.
So made a little hack in batch file command.

2) For standlone kafka service config file was required to setup listener like this
listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092

found this solution on this stackoverflow discussion which worked.
